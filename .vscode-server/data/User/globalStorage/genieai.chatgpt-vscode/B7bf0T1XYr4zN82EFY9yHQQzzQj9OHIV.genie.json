                "text": "`std::array` is a container class in C++ STL (Standard Template Library) that encapsulates fixed size arrays. It provides a safer and more efficient alternative to traditional C-style arrays by providing bounds checking, iterators, and other useful member functions. \n\n`std::array` is defined in the `<array>` header file and can be instantiated with a specified size and element type, like this:\n\n```c++\nstd::array<int, 5> myArray; // creates an array of 5 integers\n```\n\nOnce created, elements in the array can be accessed using the subscript operator `[]` or via iterators. For example:\n\n```c++\nmyArray[0] = 42;\nstd::cout << myArray[0] << std::endl; // prints 42\n\nfor (auto it = myArray.begin(); it != myArray.end(); ++it)\n{\n    std::cout << *it << \" \";\n}\n// prints: 42 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nNote that `std::array` is a stack-allocated container, meaning that its memory is allocated on the program's call stack rather than on the heap. This can make it faster and more efficient than dynamically allocated containers like `std::vector`, but also means that its size must be known at compile time."
