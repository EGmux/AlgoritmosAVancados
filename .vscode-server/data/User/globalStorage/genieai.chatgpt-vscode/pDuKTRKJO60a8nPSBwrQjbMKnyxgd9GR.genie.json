When you declare a variable like `int counter = 0;`, space is allocated on the stack to store the value of `counter`. When you later execute `counter++`, the value stored in that memory location is incremented by 1.\n\nIt's worth noting that the exact details of how variables are stored and manipulated can be complex and depend on many factors, including the compiler being used, the target platform, and the optimization settings being used.

This means that if you have multiple function calls in your program, each with their own stack frames, then the value of `counter` will only be incremented in the stack frame of the function that contains the `counter++` statement.\n\nOn the other hand, if the `counter++` statement is located outside of any function (for example, at global scope), then the value of `counter` will be incremented in the global scope stack frame.\n\nIn general, the stack frame associated with a particular piece of code is determined by the call stack at runtime.
