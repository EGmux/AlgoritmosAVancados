                "text": "To compute the height of insertion in a VEB (van Emde Boas) tree, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, compute the height of the tree using the formula `h = log2(u)`, where `u` is the universe size of the VEB tree.\n\n2. Next, recursively compute the height of the subtree that corresponds to the high-order bits of the key being inserted. To do this, you can use the same formula as before, but with a smaller universe size. Specifically, if the original universe size was `u`, then the new universe size for the subtree is `sqrt(u)`.\n\n3. Continue recursively computing the height of the subtree corresponding to each successive bit of the key, until you reach the leaf level of the tree.\n\n4. Finally, add up all the heights computed in step 3 to get the total height of insertion.\n\nHere's some sample Python code that implements this algorithm:\n\n```\nimport math\n\ndef veb_insertion_height(key, u):\n    h = math.log2(u)\n    if h == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        high_bits = key >> math.ceil(h/2)\n        low_bits = key & ((1 << math.ceil(h/2)) - 1)\n        return 1 + veb_insertion_height(high_bits, math.sqrt(u)) + veb_insertion_height(low_bits, math.sqrt(u))\n```\n\nNote that this code assumes that the keys are integers and that the VEB tree has a fixed universe size `u`. If your use case requires a variable-size VEB tree, you'll need to modify the code accordingly."
