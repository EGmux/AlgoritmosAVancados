A VSCode extension that allows you to stage/unstage files without changes and from outside the
source control window.

**Table of Contents**

## Features

- Stage/unstage files with or without changes, directly from the explorer or currently opened file.
- Integrates seamlessly with the default Git integration.

> Wait, isn't this already included in VSCode's default Git integration?

Sort of, but not really. The default Git integration only provides commands to stage/unstage files
with changes, unless you do it from the Source Control window. This can be really annoying in
situations where you have a _lot_ of untracked files (e.g. when working with bare git repos for
dotfiles).

It does however expose all the necessary APIs to achieve this under the hood, which is what this
extension is using.

## Usage

### Command palette-commands

#### Git: Stage Current File
